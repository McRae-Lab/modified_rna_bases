# RNA Base Modification Scripts üß¨ 

Herein lay vibe-coded scripts for semi-automating processes in building RNA PDB models ‚Äî use at your own peril.

These three scripts modify canonical RNA bases in .pdb structures to their modified analogs, preserving geometry.

Each script uses Biopython to modify atom coordinates and naming directly in the PDB file.
They do not rebuild bonds or hydrogens‚Äîthose are added later by Phenix ReadySet and geometry minimization.

# Requirements ‚öôÔ∏è 

Python ‚â• 3.8

Biopython ‚â• 1.8

Phenix ‚â• 1.20 (for ReadySet + Minimization)

Install Biopython if needed:

pip install biopython

# Usage üöÄ 

All scripts share the same interface:

python c_to_5mC.py -i input.pdb -o output.pdb
python u_to_pU.py  -i input.pdb -o output.pdb
python u_to_1mpU.py -i input.pdb -o output.pdb


Optional: restrict to specific residues

python c_to_5mC.py -i input.pdb -o 5mC-input.pdb -r 12,18-21


If -r is omitted, all residues of the target base type (C or U) are modified.
 
# Step 2 ‚Äì Minimize geometry in Phenix üîß

This step relieves any bond-length or angle outliers after coordinate editing.

You may need to remove hydrogens or rename them first. 

phenix.geometry_minimization 5mC-input.pdb 5MC.cif \
    selection="resname 5MC" max_iterations=300


Examples:

For 5-methyl-cytidine
phenix.geometry_minimization 5mC-input.pdb 5MC.cif \
    selection="resname 5MC"

For pseudouridine
phenix.geometry_minimization pU-input.pdb pU.cif \
    selection="resname PSU"

For 1-methyl-pseudouridine
phenix.geometry_minimization 1mpU-input.pdb 1mpU.cif \
    selection="resname 1MP"


The resulting minimized model (minimized.pdb) will have:

Correct covalent geometry

Relaxed bond lengths/angles

# Step 2 ‚Äì Fix geometry with Isolde üîß

Load the model into ChimeraX and initialize isolde, rebuilding residues to match template

Save the pdb - rename the hydrogens to match the cif file with fix_5mC_hnames.sh

# Notes üß† 

Residue names follow Phenix/Coot conventions:

5-methyl-cytidine ‚Üí 5MC

pseudouridine ‚Üí PSU

1-methyl-pseudouridine ‚Üí 1MP

Atom names match the Phenix ligand dictionary:

C5 methyl ‚Üí CM5

N1 methyl ‚Üí C1

The scripts do not change chain IDs, residue numbers, or occupancy.

Works for RNA fragments, single nucleotides, or entire models.
